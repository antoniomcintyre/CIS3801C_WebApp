  <h3>Welcome!</h3>
  <p>Within this site, I will be taking you on a tour of a few popular Martial Art styles. Worldwide there is a great diversity of martial arts. Broadly speaking, martial arts share a common goal: to defeat a person physically or to defend oneself from physical threat. Within most martial arts there is a deep sense of spirituality. Every style has a different "feeling" that helps embody the martial art.Each martial art has its own history and goals</p>

      <h3>Masters Title</h3>
      <p>The teaching of martial arts in Asia has historically followed the cultural traditions of teacher-disciple apprenticeship. Students are trained in a strictly hierarchical system by a master instructor: Sifu in Cantonese, Lao Shih, lo sh (lit., old master) in Chinese; Shih fu, Sh fÃ¹ (lit., the master-father) in Mandarin; Guru in Hindi and Sanskrit; Sensei in Japanese; Kwan Jang Nim in (Korean). The instructor is expected to directly supervise their students' training, and the students are expected to memorize and recite as closely as possible the rules and basic training routines of the school.</p>

      <h3>Modern Martial Arts</h3>
      <p>As Western influence grew in the East a greater number of military personnel spent time in China, Japan, Korea and elsewhere. Exposure to martial arts during the Korean war was also significant. Gradually some soldiers began to see the value of Eastern martial arts and began training in them. Now the Martial Art tradition is widely popular throughout the world, leading the way for self defense training for young and old alike.</p>

      <h3>The Real Meaning of Martial Arts</h3>
      <p>In our culture, we tend to focus on outcomes. Winning versus losing. Gaining weight versus losing weight. Through Martial Arts, you learn that process is growth, regardless of outcome. A journey in martial arts is a journey from within. To that end, as we grow old we need not stop growing. Our limited view of growth is expanded by the viewpoint of a martial artist. Art, in a most basic of definition is expression, and a martial artist focuses on that expression throughout the whole journey.</p>
